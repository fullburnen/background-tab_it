A Firefox WebExtensions add-on to add a context menu item for opening a link in a background tab.

~~A bit inconvenient because Firefox doesn't support access key yet, so you can't do `<Right Click> b` to trigger.~~

You can use `<Right click> b`, but that's only if Background-tab It is the first and only entry that starts with B. Otherwise, `B` only cycles through items starting with B.
